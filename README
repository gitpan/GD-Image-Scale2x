NAME
    GD::Image::Scale2x - Implementation of the Scale2x algorithm for the GD
    library

SYNOPSIS
        use GD;
        use GD::Image::Scale2x;

        # load an image
        my $image = GD::Image->new( 'file.png' );

        # scale2x, 3x, and 4x
        my $scaled2x = $image->scale2x;
        my $scaled3x = $image->scale3x;
        my $scaled4x = $image->scale4x;

        # scale a certain area
        # (10, 10) to (30, 30)
        my $scaled = $image->scale2x( 10, 10, 20, 20 );

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements the Scale2x algorithm (as well as 3x and 4x).
    From the Scale2x web site:

        Scale2x is real-time graphics effect able to increase the size of small bitmaps
        guessing the missing pixels without interpolating pixels and blurring the images.

    The algorithm itself is explained at
    http://scale2x.sourceforge.net/algorithm.html. You can see some example
    results by looking through the test directory.

METHODS
  scale2x( [ $source_x, $source_y, $width, $height ] )
    Takes an image and produces one twice a big. From the Scale2x web site:

        The effect works repeating a computation pattern for every pixel of the
        original image. The pattern starts from a square of 9 pixels and expands
        the central pixel computing 4 new pixels.

    You can specify a portion of the original image by specifying a source x
    and y plus a width and height.

  scale3x( [ $source_x, $source_y, $width, $height ] )
    A similar algorithm to scale2x, except that it produces a 9-pixel
    result.

  scale4x( [ $source_x, $source_y, $width, $height ] )
    Same as scale2x done twice over.
